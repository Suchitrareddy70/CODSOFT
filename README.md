# CODSOFT 
I finished3 tasks which are listed below
task 1 : NUMBER GAME.
task 2 : STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR.
task 3 : ATM INTERFACE.
This was an unusual task as I had never done anything of this sort earlier. I learned a great deal about javadevelopment, Learnt new things in this one. It was a wonderful experience on working with Codsoft to gain my knowledge and skills. I would really like to thank Codsoft for this amazing opportunity once again.
